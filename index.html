        <h4>Team name</h4>

            <p align="justify">After participating in the long discussion, Group 1 has all together made the decision to officially adopt the
            name "The Boi's cave" as our appointed group identity. The decision made is an expression of our common goal and
            displays the dynamic and open personality of our team. By adopting this unique appellation, our objective is to
            grow spirit of mutual respect and support among our members, while simultaneously highlighting our individual
            capacities and different points of view. Under the name of "The Boi's Cave", we find ourselves on a point of an
            incredible journey filled with exploration, innovation, and achievement.</p>

        <h4>Personal information</h4>

        <ul> 
            <li align="justify">My name is Do Thanh Luan, and my student ID is s3975161. I am currently part of The Bois Cave team. I work in IT
            but when I need a break from the stresses of everyday life, I like to entertain my friends with games that pique
            their interest. I am interested in a career in IT as the pay and job stability are very attractive. My genuine
            enthusiasm for the complex world of IT, where analytical problem solving expands, is complemented by a natural
            talent for solving complex computing challenges. In addition, I take great pleasure in exploring different
            literary genres as my never-ending interest is always satisfied. Additionally, my path into web development
            allows me to seamlessly combine creativity with technical skills. My interest in IT was sparked by the film
            Misson Impossible, which Tom Cruise is working on with a hacker. The concise presentation of the topic had an
            important effect on me and confirmed my belief in the compatibility of an IT profession and my skills and
            hobbies.</li>
            <br>
            <li align="justify"> My name is Chau Ngan Hong and here is my SID: s3813338. During my final semester of my academic career at RMIT
            Vietnam, I had the opportunity to deepen my professional application in both English and Vietnamese languages.
            Additionally, I am embarking on an exciting new adventure exploring Chinese learning and multicultural
            experiences. In addition, I read various books, follow a healthy lifestyle, and enjoy playing video games in my
            free time. IT is more than just a hobby for me. I like it because I see how it can transform businesses in the
            modern world. This convinced me to integrate IT subjects into my major. Due to my ambitious goals, I am
            passionate about leveraging the latest innovations such as AI, cloud computing and data-driven analytics. Now
            I'm part of a great young solo group called The Bois Cave who are exploring the vast possibilities of IT.</li>
            <br>    
            <li align="justify"> I am Nguyen Ngoc Huy, and my SID is s3975935. I am also a member of The Bois Cave team. I am currently enrolled
            as a freshman at RMIT Vietnam and IT is my major. As for my hobbies, I do a variety of activities. At the
            weekend, for example, I took part in a friendly badminton match with my friends. I also often went to a café
            where I spent time socializing and relaxing. I also developed joy in playing games and music. Since the
            beginning of 11th grade, I have developed a strong passion for programming. For this reason, I decided to start
            studying Python, which will be my first programming language. It should also be emphasized that the IT sector is
            experiencing continuous growth. This realization was a strong motivation for me to pursue academic studies at
            RMIT University. In this way I would like to expand my knowledge and improve my programming skills.</li>
            <br>    
            <li align="justify"> My name is Do Tuan Anh (SID: s3988516), and I am also taking part in the team “The Bois Cave”. As for my
            hobbies, I usually prefer playing video games and listening to podcasts in my free time. In addition, I work
            part-time at my uncle's shop throughout, as I am determined to finance my personal expenses independently. I
            chose IT as my major because I wanted to go deeper into the study of modern technologies and their possible
            improvements. Additionally, my older brother has been instrumental in inspiring me in the field of science,
            especially in the areas of programming and computer science. Regardless of my experience, I am relatively new to
            this field and therefore can only offer limited contributions at this time. Ultimately, my goal after completing
            this course is to further expand my contacts with industry experts and gain useful knowledge from their
            expertise.</li>

        <p align="justify">Comment audit: There are a few mistakes on our GitHub Repository page, yet we
            nevertheless must start over. However, it is important to note that we have successfully
            documented our collaborative work history efforts in the following manner:</p>
        
        <p align="justify">First step: the fundamental framework and capabilities of the website were established and
            completely mostly by Huy and Tuan Anh. The frequently and thoroughness of their
            collaboration serve to emphasise an excellent start to our website.</p>

        <h2 style="color: blue" id="project">Project Description</h2>
    
            <h3>Topic</h3>
    
                <p align="justify">Our team recognized the need for effectiveness, accessibility, and fast responses for the medical industry in
                today's growing society. With this realization, our team has developed an app called EasyMed aimed at all
                consumers with the aim of helping to meet the needs of accessible and flexible healthcare services with a
                user-friendly interface that provides quick and easy medical assistance. Additionally, EasyMed can further
                improve healthcare service experiences by allowing users to self-diagnose and treat minor to moderate
                injuries/illnesses without having to worry about a hospital visit.</p>
    
                <p align="justify">The app has some combination key features that improve the overall user experience and promote effective
                healthcare decision making. By providing users with basic information about their health status, the integrated
                X-ray function offers a significant improvement in self-diagnosis. Additionally, the availability of a live chat
                feature that allows users to have conversations with medical professionals 24/7 ensures easy access to medical
                advice that is just a few taps away on the phone. This app proves to be beneficial since it reduces the demand
                on hospital facilities while maintaining rapid care. Moreover, the implementation of prescription functionality
                reduces the process by allowing medical professionals to provide prescribed medications to the customers or
                pharmacies. Furthermore, EasyMed's booking systems promise clients to access hospital appointments without long
                wait periods (in case of emergency).</p>
    
            <h3>Motivation</h3>

                <p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.iedunote.com/img/1374/motivation-definition-meaning.jpg" width="300" align="left"></p>
                
                <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column;">
                    <p align="justify">In recent years, the IT sector has developed far beyond the mere expansion method. Additionally, the IT sector is
                    increasingly involved in business decision-making as technology adoption is critical to sustaining the growth
                    and improvement of an industry, particularly healthcare. In addition, the implementation of IT has significantly
                    improved efficiency in several areas of healthcare facilities with the ability to control data and improve
                    customer services.</p>
        
                    <p align="justify">One of the main reasons we are working on the project is to make it easier for our target customers and
                    healthcare professionals to communicate with each other by establishing a single platform with many services
                    available. The trend in IT towards digital health and healthcare makes our project more relevant to the demand
                    of customers who want quick and convenient answers to their treatment. When considering our potential value to a
                    future employer, it is important to recognize that our skills extend beyond our IT understanding. Additionally,
                    we have demonstrated our understanding of predicting market demand and designing a user-friendly interface.
                    Finally, our project shows how committed we are to creative concepts to make it easier for people to receive
                    healthcare.</p>
                </div>
            
            <h3 style=clear:left >Landscape</h3>
    
                <p align="justify">The digital healthcare industry is vast with various platforms that offer a range of medical services. Therefore,
                there are plenty of opportunities for new players to come to this market. Some of the competitor platforms are
                all extant and convey their goals in achieving a better healthcare environment through virtue assistance While
                applications like MyChart offer flexibility in scheduling medical appointments, other platforms like Doctor on
                Demand and Teladoc are more specialised in providing online doctor consultations. There is also an app called
                Ada that gives customers the ability to self-diagnose illnesses. Therefore, different competitors in this space
                need to bring their own distinctive features into their services to convince consumers.</p>
    
                <p align="justify">In contrast, our project is characterised by being well thought out. Instead of giving our customers the hurdle
                of downloading different apps on their phone, our app provides all the services with the above features in one
                and eliminates the time spent switching between apps. Overall, our approach helps customers acquire a coherent
                and more thorough medical background while ensuring a comfortable and relaxed use of our services.</p>

    <h2 style="color: blue" id="detail">Detailed Description</h2>

    <h3>Aims</h3>

    <p><image src="https://mpsinternational.in/publicimages/thumb/page/400x400/mps-international_file_116576647.png" width="300" align="right"></p>
    
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column;">

        <p align="justify">The project's aim is to develop a website that serves as an encyclopedia for the medical condition analysis app
            and can allay users' anxieties about it. They may use this website to research illnesses and their symptoms to
            fully understand the app before utilizing it. Additionally, it increases users' awareness of their health and
            provides information on the closest drugstore and hospital. Two of the most precise objectives we established to
            ensure the success of our project were to finish this application.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">The first goal is to encourage visitors to visit and use our website. This is important for maintaining
            activities and making further enhancements that are required for the project. All ages will be represented among
            the targeted consumers. Additionally, individuals must watch over the elderly and children when they use the
            program. Additionally, user feedback is crucial to enhancing the app's UI aesthetic and usability.
        </p>

        <p align="justify">The second goal is to provide reliable information regarding illnesses and symptoms based on user concerns. Users
            will be able to seek out the most complete and reliable information on sickness on this website, with the
            assistance of medical specialists. With this knowledge, they can help consumers comprehend potential medical
            concerns, make decisions, and seek medical assistance. As a consequence, consumers will be more aware of their
            health issues.</p>

    </div>

    <h3>Plans and Progress</h3>

    <p align="justify">Planning and strategizing are critical aspects of every successful project since they determine many other
        factors such as resource allocation, risk mitigation, task sequencing, communication, and so on, all of which
        directly contribute to the project's operational effectiveness. Understanding that had led us to the thought of
        creating a highly specific strategy for the project as well as for each member of our team in this endeavor. In
        this section, we will discuss the important components of our project, such as the "story" of the project, the
        main stages of the project, and what happens inside it (decisions, revisions, and some dead ends).</p>
    <p align="justify">Our team's "story" about constructing a promotional website began when assignment 2 was initially posted. 
        At the moment, in order to pick the topic for IT production, which is obviously a critical part since there 
        are several things to consider such as scope and limits, restricted knowledge and abilities, kind of product, 
        and so on, we chose to create a medical app called "MedCare" after much deliberation, which ended with a fantasy 
        setting and an intriguing narrative. Everything appeared fine at first as we sat together for hours only to develop 
        the narrative, character, and communication, which is really good because some of us have family members working in 
        the medical industry. However, once we realize that a prototype is required, we realize that we lack the necessary 
        expertise and abilities to manifest our idea. That was a difficult period for our team since we were really focused 
        and ambitious with this project, and we also nearly ran out of time because we spent so much time on it. We immediately 
        sat down again to adjust our approach to the project in order to capitalize on the previous endeavor. 
        Finally, the concept was developed into "medicalhealthcare.com," a website based on the concept of our previous 
        app "Medcare" that would give all required information for users about the disease, symptoms, news updates, 
        nearby hospital locations, and so on.</p>

    <p align="justify">Project Initiation, Project Planning, Requirement Planning, Design and Architecture, Development and
        Implementation, Testing and Quality Assurance are the five major stages in the production of an IT project. Here
        is a full account of our progress:</p>

        <ul>
            <li align="justify">Project Initiation: Identifying the need for the IT project, defining the project's objectives, and determining
            its viability are all part of this step. It involves tasks like performing a feasibility assessment and
            establishing the scope of the project. We were able to establish a correct scope for the project since our team
            understood the features of the product and had a clear idea of our expertise and competence. This has aided us
            in the planning process because we now know exactly what section will appear on the website.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li align="justify">Project Planning: During this stage, our team creates a detailed project plan that describes the project's
            timetable, resources, deliverables, and activities needed to meet the project objectives. Defining project
            milestones, developing a work breakdown structure, and estimating effort are all part of this. Everything about
            a project must be carefully reviewed in this section, since one erroneous hint from the project manager might
            lead to a domino effect in operational efficiency. Recognizing this, our project manager assigned duties to each
            team member based on their strengths and desires. This allows everyone to give it their all while also making
            extra learning easy because each person just needs to master particular areas. When it comes to project
            timelines, the project manager must determine who is accessible and how busy their calendars are for this one.
            This has aided us in developing a project timeline and determining timeframes for each milestone. In terms of
            communication, we choose to have a face-to-face meeting once per week (depending on the available time of each
            member each week) and other forms of meetings to boost communication flexibility.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li align="justify">Design and Architecture: Based on the requirements received, our team produces the system architecture and a
            complete design specification. Designing the user interface, database structure, and software components are all
            part of this. An IT project's design and architecture phases include generating a plan for the system to be
            constructed. Our time is spent studying the project requirements and comprehending its goals. The system
            architecture is then designed, with important components and their relationships identified. Following that is
            detailed design, which specifies interfaces, data structures, algorithms, and logic for each component. User
            interface design is made for projects that require a UI, whereas database design is created for projects that
            require data storage. Integration points and protocols are created to meet the needs of system integration. The
            choice of relevant technologies, frameworks, and tools is also taken into account. Design choices are captured
            in documentation and communicated to the team. Iterative modifications and design reviews guarantee that the
            design fulfills requirements and best practices. Throughout the process, team members must always collaborate
            and communicate with one another.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li align="justify">Development and Implementation: The development stage includes writing code and constructing the IT project in
            accordance with the design parameters. It entails tasks including creating code, constructing software modules,
            setting hardware and software infrastructure, and unit testing. Our team turns the concept into code, customizes
            existing software as needed, and combines various components in this section. To assure quality, the program is
            thoroughly tested before being deployed to the production environment. We must also perform additional learning
            during the process because, as freshmen, we are unfamiliar with many new technologies and even programming
            languages.</li>
            <br>
    
            <li align="justify">Testing and Quality Assurance: After development is completed, the IT project is subjected to a variety of
            testing operations to guarantee functionality, dependability, and performance. Unit testing, integration
            testing, system testing, and user acceptability testing are all included. During this stage, quality assurance
            tasks like code reviews and bug repair are also carried out. In this section, our team develops test plans and
            executes test cases to ensure functionality, performance, security, and usability. Quality assurance operations,
            such as code reviews and procedure adherence, are carried out to prevent regression issues and contribute to
            continuous development. To secure a good conclusion, collaboration and communication are essential throughout
            the testing phase.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>

    <h3>Roles</h3>

    <ul>
        <li align="justify">Project manager/ Quality Assurance: Chau Ngan Hong <br>
        I personally believe that all people in this project have equal status and a fair distribution of benefits and
        opinions. That's why I'm committed to ensuring that there are no hierarchical structures in our team. In this
        role, my goal is to ensure that all team members meet established deadlines, promote motivation, create a
        diverse and welcoming work environment, improve effective communication, and distribute tasks to match their
        individual skills. In addition, we work together to improve each other's work by fixing errors and providing
        feedback to make the result of our project appear professional. In addition, my tasks will mainly consist of
        writing report and programming various parts of this project.</li>

        and user-friendly interfaces for digital goods. They mix their artistic abilities with a thorough grasp of user
        experience to create interfaces that are both visually appealing and easy to use. A content producer, on the
        other hand, is a versatile individual who specializes at creating interesting and captivating material across
        several platforms and mediums. They are skilled at identifying the target demographic and adapting their
        material to appeal to them. Content developers have good writing and storytelling abilities, helping them to
        generate compelling narratives and effectively express ideas.The reason why I choose this role is because I have
        seen a lot of designs of an application so i can make it interesting.Furthermore, I know some basic UI knowledge 
        via google and Facebook, so this position is the best for me.</li>
        <br>
        <li align="justify">Lead Developer: Do Tuan Anh <br>
        The lead developer's role is to ensure that everyone's code and work are in excellent shape and to set plans for
        future improvements. They will also correct and debug the work of others. And, without a doubt, their duty is to
        code the core product and collaborate with other developers to complete it. I am not really a master of coding,
        but I had learned some basics about HTML, CSS, and Python before. I am in charge of the repository and general
        content coding.</li>
        <br>
        <li align="justify">Web designer : Nguyen Ngoc Huy <br>
        I take responsibility for this role which designs, builds, maintains the website. Also known as I am responsible
        for designing the structure and format of the web page. My duties are converting our report to the website -
        HTML version, decorating to make it more clearly and easier to know the main contents, making sure that image
        links, website link, repo link all work. Although I do not have many experiences in HTML after learning the
        lessons, I had done some research and found it is not too hard to design with some basic knowledge that is on
        the internet. In addition, this also helped me approach CSS which styles a web page, which is a useful language
        when using HTML to build a website.</li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>

    <p align="justify">The objective of this project is to develop an application focused on medical assistants. The
        application aims to provide users with comprehensive information regarding the disease
        they are currently facing. Additionally, our platform offers live doctor consultations,
        enabling users to schedule appointments with experienced medical professionals. During
        these consultations, users will receive expert advice and appropriate medication
        recommendations.</p>

    <p align="justify">In the context of the numerous potential enhancements that could be made to this
        application, it is important to acknowledge the constraints imposed by limited time.
        Consequently, a wise decision has been reached to incorporate only a select set of features
        that will adequately cater to the needs of users. In order to adjust to different needs, we have
        developed two distinct modes: Normal mode and endoscopy mode. The Normal mode is
        specifically designed for scanning the external surface of the body and is suitable for
        individuals with skin diseases. On the other hand, the endoscopy mode is customised for
        internal scanning with devices and is particularly beneficial for individuals with cardiac
        ischemic disease, lower respiratory tract infections, or chronic obstructive pulmonary
        disease. Furthermore, our institution offers convenient booking systems that enable
        individuals to effortlessly schedule appointments with our esteemed healthcare
        professionals. This eliminates the need to endure lengthy waiting periods and ensures
        prompt access to the necessary medical attention. Furthermore, our platform offers a live
        chat feature which facilitates seamless communication between users and medical
        specialists. This invaluable resource is available round the clock, every day of the week,
        ensuring that individuals can easily access expert medical advice with just a few taps on
        their phone. In conclusion, the implementation of prescription functionality represents a
        significant advancement in the healthcare industry. This feature effectively simplifies the
        prescription process, enabling medical professionals to conveniently prescribe medications
        to both consumers and pharmacies. Moreover, this innovative functionality not only saves
        users valuable time but also enhances their experience when searching for suitable
        medications on popular web browsers such as Google, Safari, and Firefox.</p>

    <p align="justify">One primary concern that arises for every student when undertaking this assignment is the
        scarcity of time. Designing the perfect app is a process that typically spans over several
        years, allowing for meticulous planning and execution. However, in our current situation,
        we are faced with a significantly condensed timeline of just two weeks. Moreover, it is
        important to note that an additional source of stress will be imposed upon us as we are
        required to meet various deadlines for other subjects, in addition to the one at hand.
        Consequently, this overwhelming workload may leave us feeling disheartened and
        physically drained. In conclusion, as we approach the deadline for our collaborative project,
        it is evident that there remains a substantial number of tasks to be accomplished by each
        team member, even when distributed among us.</h3>

    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
    
    <p align="justify">There are some software and other tools involved in this project. First, we need to design a
        text using VS Code, Notepad or Python to write a language - HTML for a text to be
        presented on a website. Additionally, CSS, a language for adding styles to web pages, is
        similar to HTML when creating a document. In addition, we need to use other languages
        such as SQL or Python to store and manage information in the web browser and app. In
        detail, storing symptoms of various diseases and disease-related prescribing using databases
        are essential in the design of the website and app. Last but not least, there is an online
        environment – GitHub where we can use Git, where all history changes can be saved to
        files, such as: B. changed content or date and time of the change, and through which each
        member can communicate and work on the project environment. Therefore, laptops are used
        in our implementation. Having learned VS Code, PyCharm to write HTML and CSS at
        university, our team has some experience in these areas.</p>
    
    <h3>Testing</h3>
    
    <p align="justify">Our team has already set up a plan to test the app whether it is working in the right way. In detail, the process
        and results will be identified to ensure that the less problems exist, the more complete the app becomes. For
        instance, some features which play an important role for checking the operation of the project, are accessed by
        users such as interaction on the app interface, amount of time to approach assist. After the goals are defined,
        the following step is looking for test participants because the feedback is extremely vital to collect and
        improve. The quantity of users is based on the range of various diseases which are included in the app so that
        there are at least 20 - 25 users in this test. To find out test participants, some strategies are applied to
        catch their attention such as allowing users to self-diagnose and treat minor to moderate injuries and ailments
        by using x-ray, online communication with medical professionals and having ability to carry out prescription
        functionality via social media platforms or advertisements. The users are not required to have any particular
        background due to the purpose of receiving a diverse group of participants. In addition, it also consists of
        experts with different degrees of technical expertise. As a result, we can enhance several knowledge about
        testing, identifying the process, targets and figuring out if there are any possible problems.</p>

    <h3>Risks</h3>

    <p><image src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQjbWv-t7wwxXwy23Hm2EYwUyGhvjhxMZS1cA" width="300" align="left"></p>
    
    <div style="display:flex; flex-direction: column;">
    
    <p align="justify">A successful project involves a mix of components such as technologies, tools, software, hardware, and even the
        interaction between team members in the organization. As a result, we constantly endeavor to explicitly describe
        any risks that may arise throughout the project execution process. To begin, consider the hazards associated
        with technology. Issues in website code can occur due to incorrect syntax or the absence of many HTML tag
        components, which can lead to semantic issues. As a result, the website may fail to function or produce results
        that differ from what is anticipated.</p>

    <p align="justify">The first are the hazards associated with technology. Issues in website code can occur due to incorrect syntax or
        the absence of many HTML tag components, which can lead to semantic issues. As a result, the website may fail to
        function or produce results that differ from what is anticipated. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the
        website could perform slowly due to technical concerns. As a result, precise precision is required during the
        coding process to eliminate dangers. Furthermore, paying close attention to the content of the website but
        failing to give it an obvious and appealing performance leads to the project being less appealing to users and
        decreasing the project's success.</p>
    <p align="justify">Arguments among team members regarding the idea, plan, and how to execute it may put the project in danger of
        failure, or, more subtly, they may slow the project's development and cause it to be completed late. In this
        circumstance, the position of a leader or project manager is critical because he will know how to mix all the
        diverse ideas to make the most perfect concept and then efficiently implement it.</p>

    <p align="justify">These are all potential risks associated with our project. However, we are attempting to limit it in order for
        our website to obtain the greatest outcomes.</p>

    <h3>Group process and communications</h3>

        <p>Both face-to-face interactions at RMIT and online conversations via Messenger served as
            platforms for our communication on this topic. At first it was a challenge to assign roles to
            individual group members. However, after careful review and discussion, we were able to
            successfully assign specific responsibilities to each. This achieved a sense of balance and
            equality in the contributions of each team member. Chau, the most vocal member of our
            group, takes responsibility for motivating everyone to stay focused on their tasks. In
            addition, he is responsible for setting a deadline that allows us to move efficiently to the
            following phases of our project. In addition, Chau reminds each team member of their
            individual target dates every day. We will mark the names of all members of the group who
            are not talkative and want favors. It is important to recognize that not everyone is online all
            day due to various commitments and responsibilities in their personal life. Despite the
            challenge posed by Luan's conflicting schedule, we mutually agreed to meet in person after
            Luan's classes were completed. The purpose of this meeting is to determine and assign
            specific roles and responsibilities to each member of our group. If any member of our group
            encounters difficulties during the task, they will immediately share their concerns via the
            group chat. Therefore, as a collective, we will work together to develop effective solutions
            to address these challenges. Despite our different opinions, we will vote together for the
            most notable answer. After a period of two weeks, we successfully mastered this task. These
            conflicts can arise in a variety of ways, including cases in which individuals motivate others
            to act more quickly, express disappointment over delayed responses, or make seemingly
            insignificant contributions. However, we have jointly decided to disregard this matter and
            sincerely apologize for any discrepancies. Instead, our primary goal is to focus our efforts
            on the task at hand and ensure its timely completion before the set deadline.</p>

    <h2 style="color: blue" id="group">Group Reflection</h2>

    <p>a. What went well</p>

    <p>Throughout the semester, our group, The Bois Cave, manages to complete our group
        assignments through collaborative efforts. We have chosen this approach, which provides us
        with valuable opportunities to evaluate our limitations in a diverse work environment. In
        detail, we managed to get in touch via Facebook group chat, arrange short and concise five
        to eight minutes meetings, discuss tasks, and get to know each other better. In addition, we
        managed to distribute tasks according to each member's strengths and weaknesses to further
        improve the project's workflow. Our website design benefited from Luan's creativity and
        skills in web development UI design and his passion for the complexities in IT. In addition,
        Chau Ngan Hong's ability to set deadlines, motivate and guide our team to take the right
        path of our work, research, and findings for the project, and he is mainly responsible for the
        written report. Whereas Nguyen Ngoc Huy and Do Tuan Anh provide an innovation
        perspective to the entire team and are responsible for writing HTML codes and contributing
        ideas for our project during our tasks. While everyone on the team has their own specific
        tasks, everyone also helped each other. For example, in addition to writing the report, Hong
        also supported the code of the HTML website, and others helped write the report content.</p>

    <p>b. What could be improved</p>
    <p>Despite our best efforts to maintain professional composer in our working environment, our
        group still prove we are still amateur in certain areas in understanding and cooperate with
        each other. One main problem we should address and improve on is our response times to
        each other messages. With members sometimes balancing personal concerns and school
        responsibilities, it was occasionally proven that it was hard to get in touch with each other.
        To address these issues, we should develop a daily check-in to ensure everyone stays on top
        of their assigned tasks and provides early help to avoid late work.</p>
    <p>c. What was surprising</p>
    <p>Surprisingly, everyone is very understanding and humble about their own mistakes. This
        makes our team more diverse, and we work together to find new solutions to our mistakes.
        Additionally, thanks to the unique experiences of each member of your team, we were able
        to bring together original concepts that we had not thought of before.</p>
    <p>d. What we learned about our groups</p>
    <p>My perspective has grown as The Bois Cave begins to develop. Along with everyone's
        enthusiasm, my passion for IT helped me to make the project something doable and not just
        a normal writing task. Over the course of the course, I realized that IT could help achieve
        business goals. The opportunity to work at The Bois Cave and meet new members has
        increased my confidence in the future of technology.</p>

        <li align="justify">Do Thanh Luan<br>
            The previous assignment is a complete disaster because we waited a week to begin working
            on it.In addition, all of the members of my team are dissatisfied with me due to the fact that
            I am a novice and therefore do not know how to write a sufficient amount of words. I have
            begun writing enough words for this task so that my teammates may leave me on the
            ground. And right now, thanks to our newfound wisdom, we will not repeat the same major
            mistakes twice. Concerning the writing task, we do not have any issues with it because all
            of the members completed it well in advance of the deadline, following Chau's example and
            achieving the goals that he established. Since everything is now in one convenient location,
            I believe we will receive a grade of PA or above on this work. After two projects, it is
            challenging to work together since there are many tasks to divide, but we make a solid
            team, and I am hopeful that after this assignment, we will be successful in meeting future
            deadlines</li>

        <li align="justify">Do Tuan Anh<br>
        Throughout this task, I must emphasize that I did my part admirably, as did everyone else. Unlike the last
        assignment, when we kept pushing the work until the end of the deadline, We had no problems with deadlines or
        team conflicts this time, which kept our work productivity consistent. Although it was efficient, I believe we
        could have done better if we had more time to study Javascript and CSS for the web. This project's HTML and CSS
        coding was quite enjoyable and fascinating for me. The most shocking thing was that we seldom met but still
        managed to work completely well. I believe I am learning a lot while working with the group. But the most
        important point is that working together is always preferable to working alone, not that working alone is less
        productive. Working with others creates a sense of motivation that drives us to grow and become better. We are
        exposed to teammates and various individuals, which alters us so that we can fit in an atmosphere where everyone
        is compatible, similar to how we push ourselves to adapt to the environment.</li>

        Learned from the previous assignment due to the delay in doing and finishing tasks, we made a group meeting to
        analyse, divide tasks, and set the deadlines for different tasks. Overall, we have done everything so well and
        have more time to check and resolve whether anything goes wrong. I wish I could have more time to undertake
        research about HTML and CSS to make our website more attractive and maybe professional. But now, I feel
        satisfied with the result and I am also surprised that I can make the website with some basic knowledge and
        information from lessons and the internet. In addition, I am interested in learning HTML and CSS because I can
        know more areas in IT that will be useful in the future. During the assignment, I acknowledged that we should
        not just finish our own duties and wait for others to finish or do everything by themselves, this will lead to
        the less effective in a group. Thus, I will always be willing to help other teammates if they get in any
        troubles or need help and I will also ask whether I have difficulties too. In conclusion, there are three main
        things that I learned from this assignment and in the group: gaining more knowledge and practising HTML, CSS;
        starting to conduct the assignment as soon as possible; having a spirit of teamwork.</li>
